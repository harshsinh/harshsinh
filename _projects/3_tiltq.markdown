    Marker Based Landing with our Tilt-Augmented Quadrotor.

Take a look at the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czgc6OZPnDw).

The task which we took on here was the fully autonomous landing of a quadrotor on a moving vehicle when the only input used for obtaining the position of the vehicle was visual and no communication existed between the vehicle and the quadrotor.

We have submitted the paper to [Control and Engineering Practices](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/control-engineering-practice), an Elsevier Journal.

The quadrotor platform we used is an inhouse developed fully actuated platform named "ASTAIR".
