I am a senior year Undergraduate student in Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Kanpur.
I am pursuing a second major in Electrical Engineering Department at the same time. I am interested in Robotics, Control Systems and Computer Vision. Most of my research has focused on cheaper solutions for accurate localization.

I love working on complex problems which involve lots of different optimizaitons, robotics competitions provided me with the same. At IIT Kanpur, I split my time working on [Autonomous Underwater Vehicle](auviitk.com), [Robocon](http://students.iitk.ac.in/robocon/) and [Intelligent Ground Vehicle](https://igvc-iitk.github.io/).

I have recently developed an interest in AI Safety mostly through books and discussions with my friend [Shibhansh Dohare](http://shibhansh.github.io/).
